factset-test

  

#General instructions:

  

The Task is composed of 2 parts frontend and backend:

1. frontend part : `factset-frntend` built with React.js . <br/>

2. backend part : `factset-curency-api` mockup API with json-server .

  

You can check how I planned the task here : https://trello.com/b/gL7AxrOq/factset-test .<br/>

  

PS: I started to transform the fake API to a real API with mongoDB, express.js and node.js but still not finished yet : you can check the advancement under `under-construction-express-api`
